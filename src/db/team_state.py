Team State Repository — Phase 4 Live Adaptive Pipeline

CRUD operations for the team_state table.
This is the persistent, evolving representation of each team's
current strength, form, and fitness.

Every query for team stats now checks here FIRST, falling back
to the hardcoded defaults only for cold-start teams.
