"""
Poisson Goal Model — The Classical Football Prediction Engine.

Calculates per-match expected goals (λ) using attacking strength
and defensive weakness ratios, then derives exact probabilities
for every goal market via the Poisson distribution.

Key formulas:
  attack_strength = team_avg_scored / league_avg_scored
  defense_weakness = opponent_avg_conceded / league_avg_conceded
  λ_home = attack_home × defense_away × league_avg_home_goals
  λ_away = attack_away × defense_home × league_avg_away_goals

This makes Arsenal at home vs Brighton away
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from Bournemouth at home vs Brentford away.
